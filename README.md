# Browser Play Button

This tiny add-on adds a play button to the Anki Browser toolbar.
When clicked, it looks for `[sound:...]`-tags on the selected note
and plays them in the order of their appearance on the note's fields.
If there is selected text, the action is limited to the sound tags
that appear only in the selected text.

Audio can be directly played with a shortcut: `alt + m`.

This add-on is similar to
[Play audio in browser](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/388541036)
but doesn't create any dialog windows when playing audio.
